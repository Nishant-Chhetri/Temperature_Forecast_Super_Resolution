# Temperature_Super_Resolution
Increasing Fine-Scale Temperature Details from Weather Model Forecasts

PROBLEM STATEMENT

This challenge is to increase the resolution (the level of detail)of 2D surface temperature forecasts obtained from Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) â€™s weather forecast model, using as labelled images 2D temperature analysis at higher resolution. The scale factor between the model and the higher resolution analysis is 4 (from 10 km to 2.5 km). Numerous and relevant 2D low-resolution weather forecast fields are provided as predictors in the training set. In addition to temperature, these include fields like cloud coverage, wind, humidity, topography, etc. are also included in the training set files.
